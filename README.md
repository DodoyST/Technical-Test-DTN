# ðŸ§¾ General Ledger Journal Processor (Kotlin)

This project is a **Kotlin console application** that processes accounting journal entries from a **JSON file** and automatically posts them into a **general ledger**.

Each journal entry updates the related account balances (assets, liabilities, revenue, etc.), producing a detailed ledger report and final account balance summary.
